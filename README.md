**üìù Module Project | Defeat the Evil Wizard**

### **OVERVIEW**

In this mini-project, you will create a hero character and battle the powerful Evil Wizard. You'll use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to extend starter code, customize your character, and add new functionality. Through a simple menu system, you'll control your character by choosing actions like attacking, using special abilities, healing, and viewing stats. Your task is to modify the starter code and defeat the Evil Wizard by implementing your own logic and design.

## **üéØ LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

* **Understand OOP Principles:** Practice inheritance, methods, and interactions between objects in Python.  
* **Build Interactive Programs:** Implement a menu system for a turn-based game.  
* **Design Game Logic:** Manage attacks, healing, and enemy interactions to make gameplay dynamic.

## **üîß STARTER CODE**

Start Code is attached at the bottom of this document so make sure to scroll down to get it before you start\!  Extend it to complete the project.

## **üìã PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**

### **Create Your Own Character Classes:**

* Add **two new character classes** in addition to Warrior and Mage. Examples include:  
  * **Archer**: A ranged attacker with abilities to shoot arrows and evade attacks.  
  * **Paladin**: A defensive hero who can heal and shield against attacks.

### **Implement Special Abilities:**

* Each character must have **two unique abilities**, such as:  
  * **Archer**: "Quick Shot" (double arrow attack) and "Evade" (avoid next attack).  
  * **Paladin**: "Holy Strike" (bonus damage) and "Divine Shield" (blocks the next attack).

### **Add a Healing Mechanic:**

* Implement a heal() method that restores health but does not exceed the maximum.

### **Build a Turn-Based Battle System:**

* Players must choose actions such as **attacking, healing, using abilities,** or **viewing stats**.

### **Evil Wizard Logic:**

* The evil wizard should **regenerate health** and **attack the player** after each turn.

### **Display Victory/Defeat Messages:**

* End the game with a **victory message** for the player or a **defeat message** if the wizard wins.

---

## **üì§ DELIVERABLES**

* A **Python script** containing:  
  * Four character classes (including two new ones).  
  * Two unique abilities for each character.  
  * A working **turn-based battle system**.  
* Display **victory or defeat messages** at the end.

---

## **üöÄ BONUS TASKS (Optional):**

* Create additional character classes with more complex mechanics.  
* Add **random elements** to the wizard‚Äôs attacks or **advanced abilities** (e.g., summoning minions).

---

## **üì• HOW TO SUBMIT**

* Submit your completed **Python script** via Google Classroom as a GitHub repository.  
* Ensure all features are implemented, and the game is fully functional.
